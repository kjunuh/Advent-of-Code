 My solutions to the advent of code questions found here: https://adventofcode.com/
 
None of the code has been edited at all from the time that I wrote it. As such, most of the solutions will probably not be very short or optimized. I'll be updating this readme periodically with my personal timing/rankings for each day/part.
