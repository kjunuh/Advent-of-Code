# AoC
My solutions to the advent of code questions found here: https://adventofcode.com/
 
None of the code has been edited from the time that I wrote it. As such, most of the solutions will probably not be very short, elegant, or optimized. While my goal in doing advent is primarily to learn and improve, making the leaderboard at least once could be fun, so I'll be going as fast as I can.
